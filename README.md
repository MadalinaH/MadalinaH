I am a self-taught developer and career changer, having previously worked in Quality Management System and Quality Assurance roles. My specialties include learning new skills, programming languages and frameworks, and problem-solving. So far I have under my belt Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
